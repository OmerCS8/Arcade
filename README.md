# Arcade Simulator Console App

This is a C++ console application that simulates an arcade with multiple games that can be played simultaneously. The app allows users to play Checkers, Amazonas, and Chess with the ability to switch between them easily. The project uses object-oriented principles such as polymorphism and serialization to enable saving and loading of games in mid-play, and to make the app extendable for the addition of new games.

## Installation

To install and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable file to start the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, follow the on-screen instructions to play the games. You can switch between games by entering the corresponding command. The app also supports saving and loading of games in mid-play using serialization.

## Contributing

This app was written as part of a C++ course at The Academic College of Tel Aviv Yaffo by Omer Cohen Shor and Omri Yoffe.
